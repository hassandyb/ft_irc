# ft_irc

## Introduction

Welcome to **ft_irc**, where you dive deep into the world of real-time communication by building your very own IRC server! This project is an exciting challenge that pushes your understanding of network protocols, client-server architecture, and the foundations of internet communication. If you've ever wondered how chat rooms and messaging platforms work behind the scenes, this is your chance to discover the mechanics, from the ground up.

## Why IRC?

**IRC (Internet Relay Chat)** is one of the earliest forms of real-time online communication, introduced in the late 1980s. Despite its age, IRC is still widely used in communities that value its lightweight and straightforward approach to messaging. It has a rich history and laid the groundwork for many of the modern chat systems we use today, like Slack and Discord.

The brilliance of IRC lies in its simplicity. It uses a straightforward text protocol that’s easy to understand, yet powerful enough to support complex communication channels, private messaging, and extensive community management tools.

### Project Scope

In this project, you will create a fully functional IRC server capable of handling multiple clients, facilitating conversations across channels, and managing user interactions based on a set of standardized rules. By the end of the project, your server will be able to:

- Allow clients to connect using any IRC client.
- Support basic IRC commands such as `JOIN`, `PART`, `PRIVMSG`, `NICK`, and more.
- Handle channels where multiple users can chat together.
- Support private messaging between individual users.
- Ensure protocol compliance according to the IRC RFC standards.

## Understanding IRC: The Basics

### The Client-Server Model

IRC operates on a **client-server model**, where clients (users) connect to a centralized server that facilitates all communication. When a client sends a message, the server routes it to the appropriate recipient(s) — whether that’s a public channel or a private user.

The server acts as the backbone of communication, managing everything from user nicknames to handling commands and distributing messages across multiple clients seamlessly.

### Channels and Communication

Channels are the heart of IRC. They are virtual rooms where users gather to chat. Channels start with a `#` (e.g., `#general`, `#tech-discussion`). Anyone who joins a channel can see and participate in the conversation happening within it.

- **Public Channels**: Open to everyone. These are the default type and are where most group discussions happen.
- **Private Channels**: Restricted access channels, usually requiring an invite or a password.

IRC also supports **private messaging** between users through the `PRIVMSG` command, enabling direct, confidential conversations.

### User Management and Modes

IRC gives users unique **nicknames** and provides tools for managing user behavior. Channels can have operators (admins) who moderate discussions, manage users, and enforce channel rules. Users and channels can be assigned different **modes** (e.g., `+o` for operator, `+i` for invite-only), adding layers of control and customization.

### Commands and Protocols

The IRC protocol revolves around a set of predefined commands. These commands follow a strict format defined in RFC 2812, which you will implement as part of this project. Some key commands include:

- **NICK**: Assigns or changes a user’s nickname.
- **JOIN**: Joins a user to a specific channel.
- **PART**: Leaves a channel.
- **PRIVMSG**: Sends a private message to a user or a channel.
- **QUIT**: Disconnects from the server.

Understanding and correctly implementing these commands is essential to making your server functional and compatible with IRC clients.

## The Role of RFCs in Internet Standards

RFCs (Request for Comments) are documents that define the protocols and technologies governing the internet. For this project, **RFC 2812** serves as your blueprint. It outlines how IRC messages should be formatted, how clients and servers should interact, and the rules that ensure any standard IRC client can connect to your server.

Complying with RFC 2812 means that your server will not only be functional but will also be interoperable with other IRC servers and clients — a fundamental principle in the world of internet standards.

## Core Implementation Challenges

### 1. **Socket Programming**: The backbone of your server is socket programming, which handles the connections between clients and the server. Mastering socket programming is key to ensuring that your server can efficiently manage multiple users, relay messages, and maintain stable connections.

### 2. **Command Parsing and Message Handling**: The server must accurately interpret and process commands from clients. This involves parsing messages, validating them, and executing the appropriate actions. The ability to properly decode and respond to commands like `JOIN`, `NICK`, and `PRIVMSG` is crucial.

### 2. **Protocol Compliance and Error Handling**: Adhering strictly to the protocol ensures your server behaves predictably and remains compatible with various clients. Robust error handling is also necessary to manage malformed commands, unexpected inputs, and disconnections gracefully.

## Conclusion: The Value of Building an IRC Server

By undertaking the ft_irc project, you gain practical experience in:

- **Network Programming and Protocol Design**: You’ll explore the intricacies of network communication and how protocols enable interoperability.
- **Client-Server Architectures**: You’ll build a fully operational server, reinforcing your understanding of how distributed systems work.
- **Real-World Standards Compliance**: You’ll learn the importance of adhering to established standards and how they enable communication across diverse systems.
- **Problem-Solving and Debugging**: You’ll face and overcome challenges that are common in real-world software engineering, especially in areas like concurrency and network reliability.

Ultimately, ft_irc is more than just a coding exercise; it’s a gateway to understanding how the internet really works — from the protocols that run it to the systems that make global communication possible.
